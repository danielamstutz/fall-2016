<h3 id="course-description">Course Description</h3>
<p>This course is the first course for a student planning to study computer programming. The course content introduces the student to both procedure-oriented and object-oriented programming languages. Structured computer programs will be written with an emphasis on procedure-oriented programming. Topics will include objects, classes, methods, properties, flowcharting, pseudocode, top down design, logic structures, data structures and types, decisions, subroutines, looping, sequential file processing, arrays and building graphical user interfaces.</p>

<h3 id="course-objectives">Course Objectives</h3>
<p>The following objectives will be addressed in the course:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Explain the importance of abstraction and decomposition in computer programming.</li>
  <li>Use appropriate program documentation, programming style and language conventions.</li>
  <li>Solve problems using decisions and branching in program flow.</li>
  <li>Solve problems using iteration (looping) in program flow.</li>
  <li>Solve problems using arrays, lists, and key value pairs.</li>
  <li>Use abstraction and decomposition to build a modular program.</li>
  <li>Develop programs to solve real-world problems.</li>
  <li>Create test data, test, and debug programs.</li>
  <li>Solve problems using recursion.</li>
  <li>Construct algorithms for solving cross-disciplinary problems.</li>
  <li>Identify the core features of object-oriented programming.</li>
  <li>Compare and contrast functional/procedural and object-oriented programming.</li>
</ul>
